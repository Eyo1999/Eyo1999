Hi, I’m Eyosias 👋

I am a self-taught learner focused on Cloud Engineering and DevOps.

Currently, I am building strong foundations in:
- Python (scripting and automation)
- Linux (system and networking basics)
- Computer Networking fundamentals

My long-term goal is to become a Cloud / DevOps Engineer who builds reliable, scalable systems and automation tools.

I believe in consistency, discipline, and learning by doing.
