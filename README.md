### Hi, I’m Eyosias 👋

I am a self-taught learner focused on **Cloud Engineering and DevOps.**

Currently, I am building strong foundations in:

- Linux basics (file system, processes, permissions, services)
- Networking (IP, DNS, HTTP/S, ports, routing, NAT, firewalls)
- System administration (users, groups, package management, logs)
- Bash scripting for automating simple tasks
- Basic Python scripting (log parsing, API calls, automation scripts)

My long-term goal is to become a **Cloud / DevOps Engineer** who builds reliable, scalable systems and automation tools.

**I believe in consistency, discipline, and learning by doing.**
